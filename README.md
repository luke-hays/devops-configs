# Devops Configs
This repo is just a collection of Devops tooling that I'm experimenting with. Workflows in here are meant to be manually kicked off, and I may install vulnerable dependencies or known issues occasionally just to trigger errors/warnings/failure in a pipeline. Nothing in here will be deployed or used in any meaningful way. Its more referential.

## Notes on Workflows

- gh-node: small node web application, uses Semgrep for SAST and OWASP Dependency Check for SCA.
